name: "Position of the Spanish Network on Software Architecture and Variability (TASOVAPLUS) Regarding the Future of SPLC"
description: "TASOVA PLUS, a consortium of researchers from 13 different universities, is deeply concerned about the future of the Software Product Line Conference (SPLC), which one of our network nodes is organizing in 2025.<br>Our goal is to ensure that SPLC remains a leading and influential conference worldwide. To achieve this, we propose the following actions:<br>
<ul>
    <li> Collaboration with related Conferences: we propose to establish connections with related conferences such as ICSR, VaMoS, GPCE, ConfWS, ECSA, and ICSA. By sharing experiences and concerns, we can strengthen the entire research community. Continuing the colocation efforts made so far is a good starting point in this direction. 
    </li>
    <li> Joint Conference: In 2026, we propose to organize a larger conference by combining SPLC with ICSR and VaMoS. This joint effort will enhance participation and reputation.
    </li>
</ul>
While there may be other strategies to engage researchers and elevate the conference’s standing, we believe these two action points are critical for SPLC’s immediate future."
